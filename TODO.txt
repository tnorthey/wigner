DONE! --- automate getting r12.dat, r23.dat, etc.

DONE! --- 000001.xyz -> 000001.dat (IAM curves; borrow a lot of already written python)

DONE! --- chi2 for each PCD

- do the workflow part on the cluster...
  - makes more sense, especially for ~100,000

- use -x option in Sharc. Not convert all to individual xyzs...
  - doesn't really matter though. (it is super slow writing 100k files...)
  - all python, read_xyz_traj() - save as npz to avoid doing it more than once

  - same with pcds; pcd.npz, distances.npz

- testing: s0p2 1000K, gives unrealistic geometries
 - seems that I cannot open the ring this much by a simple wigner dist
 - maybe I can open in 10 fs increments (not 20 or 30 fs)

the Gaussian fitting thing for each bond-length
- and plots

find the closest xyz file to the Gaussian fitted distances
